quizzyBuilder 2.0 is a companion tool to the PHP library quizzy. It can be used to graphically build quizzes
that are usable by the quizzy library.

To use quizzyBuilder on your server, just extract this archive into its own folder on your server and go index.php
in your web browser. Your server must be running PHP 5 for simpleXML
You can also just use the public quizzyBuilder on the quizzy homepage at http://quizzy.sf.net/quizzyBuilder
It might be more desirable to use online version because it is guaranteed to be the latest version and the current
version of quizzyBuilder produces several warnings in PHP if warnings are turned on.
